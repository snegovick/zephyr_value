description: GPIO-controlled extended regulators

# include: regulator.yaml

# NOTE: The driver supports "regulator-extended-sync" as a specializing
# variant when it's known that the GPIO state change operations are
# isr-ok and not sleep, and both startup and off-on delays are zero.
# This bypasses the asynchronous onoff manager which optimizes both time
# and memory use.
#
# To enable this use both:
#    compatible = "regulator-extended-sync", "regulator-extended";
#

compatible: regulator-extended

      GPIO to use to enable/disable the regulator.

      Unlike the gpio property in the Linux bindings this array must
      provide the GPIO polarity and open-drain status in the phandle
      selector.  The Linux enable-active-high and gpio-open-drain
      properties are not valid for Zephyr devicetree files.

  Unified value views.

  The values will be displayed like the following:

  <entry[0]><entry[1]>...<entry[columns]>
  <entry[columns+1]>...

  Each entry represented as follow:

  [<name><name-sep>]<value><value-sep>

  If no names is configured then name won't shown at all.

  The source values assumed to be represented as numbers with a fixed-point.

  The output representation is a decimal so the viewed values calculated like so:

      <int_part>[.<fract_part>]

      int_part = round(value * factor / scale);

      if presision > 0:
          fract_part = round(abs(value) * factor % scale * 10 ^ fract_digits / scale)

  Config example:

      views {
          vas {
              compatible = "value-view";
              name = "vas";
              help = "Show measured voltages and currents";
              names = "Vin", "Vout", "Iout";
              values = <&v_sensor 1>, <&v_sensor 0>, <&i_sensor2 0>;
              scales = <(1 << 24)>, <(1 << 24)>, <(1 << 16)>;
              fract-digits = <3>, <3>, <1>;
              units = "V", "V", "A";
          };
          /* ...other views */
      };
